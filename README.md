# MongoDB example app
This app connects to a MongoDB database, creates a collection, populates it with items, then drops the collection and closes the connection.

credit to Anish Karandikar (anishkny) who wrote the original code. I have taken it to modify and play with so I learn how to use a mlab mongodb database.
